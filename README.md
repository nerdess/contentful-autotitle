    ...hit save!

## How to use

Each content type in your content model needs an entry title. To make use of the extension and autmatically generate that title you need to edit the entry title of a content type. 

1. Go to `Content model` and select the content type you want to edit or create a new one.

2. Edit the `Entry title` field and click on `Appearance`. Select the custom extension and add some Field-Ids. These fields will be used to automatically generate the title.

3. Save and start editing your content!

## Todo

This is just a first (but working!) proof-of-concept. I need to cleanup the code a bit, write some tests and all that stuff ðŸ™ˆ
